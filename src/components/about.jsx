Hello! I’m Zaheer Abbas, a passionate and aspiring MERN Stack Developer from Vellore. My journey into the world of web development began with a strong desire to explore the digital realm and create impactful solutions.

I hold a Bachelor of Commerce (B.Com) degree from C. Abdul Hakeem College, where I completed my graduation in November 2022. Prior to this, I completed my schooling at K.H. Boys Higher Secondary School, which laid the foundation for my dedication and determination.

After graduation, I worked at Solar Soles Private Limited, a renowned shoe sole production company located in Walaja. From October 2022 to June 2023, I served as a Supervisor, where I developed my skills in team management, problem-solving, and maintaining high-quality production standards. However, my interest in technology motivated me to transition into the field of web development.

To pursue my new career path, I enrolled in the MERN Stack Developer Course at Error Makes Clever Academy. Here, I gained hands-on experience in building full-stack web applications using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. This course not only strengthened my technical expertise but also enhanced my ability to create efficient and scalable web applications.

Now, as a fresher in web development, I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills to real-world projects. I am actively seeking opportunities to contribute as a Web Developer, where I can collaborate with innovative teams, learn from experienced professionals, and build a successful career in the tech industry.

When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, learning about the latest trends in web development, or planning creative projects to sharpen my skills.</p>
